The first input array contains the correct answers to an exam, like ["a", "a", "b", "d"]. The second one is "answers" array and contains student's answers.

The two arrays are not empty and are the same length. Return the score for this array of answers, giving +4 for each correct answer, -1 for each incorrect answer, and +0 for each blank answer(empty string).

If the score < 0, return 0.

For example:

checkExam(["a", "a", "b", "b"], ["a", "c", "b", "d"]) → 6
checkExam(["b", "c", "b", "a"], ["",  "a", "a", "c"]) → 0

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. 
If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

#Examples:
get_middle("test") should return "es"
get_middle("testing") should return "t"
get_middle("middle") should return "dd"

#Input
A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000.

#Output
The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Example:

high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5")  # return "5 1"

Notes:

All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
There will always be at least one number in the input string.
Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). 
Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. 
When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. 
The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not 
capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

Example:

Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

Complete the function that counts the number of unique consonants in a string (made up of printable ascii characters).

Consonants are letters used in English other than "a", "e", "i", "o", "u". We will count "y" as a consonant.

Remember, your function needs to return the number of unique consonants - disregarding duplicates. 
For example, if the string passed into the function reads "add", 
the function should return 1 rather than 2, since "d" is a duplicate.

Similarly, the function should also disregard duplicate consonants of differing cases. 
For example, "Dad" passed into the function should return 1 as "d" and "D" are duplicates.

Examples

"add" ==> 1
"Dad" ==> 1
"aeiou" ==> 0
"sillystring" ==> 7
